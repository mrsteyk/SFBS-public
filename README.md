# Starfield DLSS (Sep 2023)

DLSS + broken DLSSG for Starfield. Last time I touched this was @ Sep 6 of 2023, almost a year has passed.

Notable info:
 - Used to contain a patch to bypass DLSSG requirements check. Removed.
 - DLSSG worked on 3060 but it just copied the frame not doing anything, didn't work on 4090, I won't fix it.
 - Propper DLSS hook by patching into renderpass logic! Yay to game tailored modding!
